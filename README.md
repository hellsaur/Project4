# PROJECT BikeUs


### PROJECT GOALS

1. Create an API using `Rails` that possesses full CRUD functionalities.
- POST creates:
- GET :
- PUT :
- DELETE :
2. Create a `React.js` application that presents the API's data in a user-friendly way.

### APPROACH

The Idea:  If you live in a city, you may not have the space for a bike or a safe place to lock it up. For example, if you live on the 20th floor of an apartment building, where can you put your bike?

Problem solved with BikeUs, a delivery service for bicycle rentals. This will allow customers to ride together with friends when you don't have a bike.

Type of Site: Delivery

Key Functions:

   Form that allows a user to book a bike for a certain number of hours at a certain hourly rate, and stores that in a database. User must input their name, address etc.
    Calendar that shows different times that bikes are available. Check out Zipcar for an example of this.
    Product details page that shows the bikes and tells you more about the different add-ons, like helmets and other protections.
    Social media integration with Instagram that shows all the awesome places people have BikeUs at.
    A checkout process and payments system with Stripe so users can complete the process.
